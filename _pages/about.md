## Who Am I?

I'm Andrew Kapaldo, a cybersecurity enthusiast and CTF player based in West Virginia. I'm passionate about breaking things (ethically!) to understand how they work, and I document my learning journey through detailed writeups and security research.

## Background

With a strong foundation in information technology and cybersecurity, I hold multiple industry certifications and continue to expand my knowledge through hands-on practice and continuous learning.

### Certifications
- **(ISC)² CCSP** - Certified Cloud Security Professional
- **(ISC)² SSCP** - Systems Security Certified Practitioner  
- **CompTIA Security+** (May 2021) - SY0-501
- **CompTIA Pentest+** - (January 2023) PT0-002
- **CompTIA Network+** (June 2022) - N10-008
- **CompTIA A+** (May 2021) - 220-1001/1002

### Education
- **Currently Pursuing: MS in Business Cybersecurity Management** (Expected 2026)
- **BS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance** - Focus on a wide range of cybersecurity topics and domains
- **AAS in Information Systems** - Focus on system administration and networking
- **Certificate of Applied Science in Cyber Security** - Specialized cybersecurity training


## What I Do

### CTF Competitions
I actively participate in Capture The Flag competitions to sharpen my technical skills and learn new attack techniques. My focus areas include:

- 🌐 **Web Application Security** - Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps
- 🔍 **Digital Forensics** - Analyzing memory dumps, disk images, and network traffic
- 🐞 **Malware Analysis** - Reverse engineering malicious software
- 🕵️ **OSINT** - Open source intelligence gathering and reconnaissance
- 🔐 **Cryptography** - Breaking ciphers and cryptographic implementations

### Community Service
When I'm not solving CTF challenges, I volunteer with my local search and rescue team, helping find lost and missing children and adults in the Morgantown, WV area. I believe strongly in using technology and technical skills to make a positive impact on people's lives.

### Professional Work
I work in the technology field, applying security principles to help organizations protect their systems and data. My experience spans system administration, network security, and security analysis.

## Current Projects

### Tool Development
I develop custom Python scripts and tools to automate CTF tasks and improve my workflow. Some areas I'm exploring:
- Automated reconnaissance and enumeration tools
- Custom exploit development frameworks
- CTF challenge solvers and automation scripts

## Skills & Tools

### Programming Languages
- **Python** - Primary language for scripting and exploit development
- **PowerShell** - Windows automation and security analysis
- **Bash** - Linux system administration and scripting
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Web development and understanding web vulnerabilities

### Security Tools
- **Burp Suite** - Web application testing
- **Wireshark** - Network traffic analysis
- **Ghidra** - Reverse engineering and malware analysis
- **Metasploit** - Exploitation framework
- **Nmap** - Network scanning and enumeration
- **SQLmap** - Automated SQL injection testing
- **John the Ripper** - Password cracking
- **Volatility** - Memory forensics

### Platforms
- **Kali Linux** - Primary penetration testing OS
- **Windows/Windows Server** - Enterprise environments
- **VMware ESXi** - Virtualization and lab management

## Learning Goals

I'm always working to expand my knowledge and skills. Current learning objectives include:

### 2026-2027 Goals
- 🎯 **CISSP Certification** - Pursuing the gold standard in security certifications
- 📚 **Master's Degree** - Completing MS in Business Cybersecurity Management
- 🔒 **OSCP** - Offensive Security Certified Professional
- 🌐 **Advanced Web AppSec** - Deep diving into complex web vulnerabilities
- 🐛 **Reverse Engineering** - Advanced binary analysis and malware development understanding

### Continuous Learning
- Regular participation in CTF competitions (Huntress, Flare-On, HackTheBox)
- Following the latest security research and vulnerability disclosures
- Contributing to open-source security tools and projects
- Building and maintaining realistic attack/defense scenarios in my home lab

## Why This Site?

This site serves multiple purposes:

1. **Documentation** - Recording my CTF solutions and learning for future reference
2. **Knowledge Sharing** - Helping others learn from my approaches and mistakes
3. **Portfolio** - Demonstrating my technical skills and problem-solving abilities
4. **Personal Growth** - Writing about challenges forces deeper understanding

I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge with the community. Every writeup represents hours of research, trial and error, and eventual success (or instructive failure). If my writeups help even one person learn something new or overcome a challenge, then the time spent documenting is worthwhile.

## Site Information

This site is built using:
- **Jekyll** - Static site generator
- **Minimal Mistakes** - Clean, responsive theme
- **GitHub Pages** - Free hosting
- **Custom automation** - Syncing writeups from my private CTF repository

All writeups are my own work unless explicitly stated otherwise. I write these primarily for myself as learning documentation, but I share them publicly in the hope they might help others.
