## Challenge Prompt

My friend Sandy is really into cryptocurrencies! She's been trying to get me into it too, so she showed me a lot of Chrome extensions I could add to manage my wallets. Once I got everything sent up, she gave me this cool program!

She says it adds better protection so my wallets can't get messed with by hackers.

Sandy wouldn't lie to me, would she...? Sandy is the best!
