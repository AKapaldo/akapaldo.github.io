## Problem Type
- Web
- IDOR


## Solve
This week kicks off with another `.onion` extension on our site, thus we will again need the Tor Browser. You can get that from the [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org) if you don’t have it already.

We visit the site and are presented with the "Silk Road" marketplace. The site offers a variety of things for sale including `FlareCTF Flag LEAKED!` which we are very interested in, well, maybe the eggnog too - 'tis the season after all!

So I clciked on the FlareCTF Flag Leaked item and it tells me I need to login to buy on the button.

At the top right is a `login` link so, let's try that. On this page we are presented with a username and password login box. I tried `admin`/`admin`.<br>
This didn't work, but said we can use the demo account of `buyer`/`silkroad`. So, let's try that.
<img width="419" height="309" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-22 at 5 40 42 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/167e39e1-490d-4fe2-b936-64625dcae7f9" />

That allowed us to log in and I quickly noticed the `Orders 2` at the top. 
<img width="942" height="699" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-22 at 5 42 37 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/676beb28-8c02-491f-b357-388a099bb5cd" />

So let's go to the `My Orders` link. Here we are presented with our 2 orders, one delivered and one shipped.
<img width="959" height="418" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-22 at 5 45 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e1e8867-7063-4d78-a694-5711cf17b8b2" />

I clicked on `View Details` of the delivered order and again quickly noticed that our order number was part of the URL `?id=157`. This means the site might be vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference, or IDOR, attack.<br>
To test, we can just change the number `157` to something else like `156` and see if it shows us someone else's order.
<img width="1184" height="657" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-22 at 5 46 49 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7290e84a-c4fe-4055-a80c-2e2f0a7d67a8" />

Let's try 156 first.
<img width="1180" height="649" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-22 at 5 50 14 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e3df87a-c1c8-4cd6-92ed-baed09a48269" />

Success! I'll spare you the bordom of me testing `156` - `149` and not finding anyhting before trying to start at `1` and working up.

Working my way up from `1`, at `3` we hit the jackpot and landed on a purchase of the FlareCTF Flag Leaked, which revealed the flag!
