## Challenge Prompt

We had a lot of fun helping the Internet understand what MDRs are, but we thought of the next the best thing:
why not have you use one! 😄

A host that you protect had some strange alerts fire off... can you analyze and triage to find other malicious activity?

## Problem Type
- UUEncoding
- Chrome History Analysis

## Solve
Initial page said the GTRS and Baby Shark files were removed.<br>
Navigated to their location 'C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads'
Found GTRS file still existed.<br>
Found Chrome installer in the same directory.<br>
Downloaded and reviewed GTRS file.<br>
Commands in go start with `STARTCOMMAND` and end with `ENDCOMMAND`.

Found Chrome logs in `C:\users\administrator\appdata\local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`

History file

Downloaded logs and reviewed. Found Commands with `STARTCOMMAND` then 
```
begin 664
<jibberish here>
End
```

Found this was [UUEncoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uuencoding).

Installed sharutils<br>
Used:
```bash
uudecode <file>
```
For each chunk to get the flag.<br>


## Flag
`flag{69200c13dcb39de19a405e9d1f993821}`
