<p>Hey Support Team,</p>

<p>Thanks for your help the other day! After seeing the way you handled yourself and gathered these details, 
I wanted to see if I could get a bit more help from you. I know you found their username the other day. 
See what you can do with that. I need you to find the town that this hacker lives in. I don’t think the IR firm is doing enough. 
I want to have every piece of information we can find. Maybe we can pay a visit. Let me know what you find. Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!IMPORTANT]
This challenge DOES NOT require you to contact any businesses.
This can be fully solved with publicly available information.
Being that this is OSINT and public-facing, please DO NOT do anything to disrupt other CTF players or others that are not involved with the CTF.</p>
